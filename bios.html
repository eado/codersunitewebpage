				<p>Why are you involved with Coders Unite? Why do you like this club? <br/><br/>Iâ€™m involved in Coders Unite because I think computers allow us to connect. Connect to our passions and share them with others. Connect to people all around the globe with similar interests, to help us learn and grow. Today we can do everything in a simple click. You can order lunch, read a book or the paper, you can work in the comfort of your home or a coffee shop with a laptop, you can watch movies, play game, listen to music. You can contact people and talk with them through your microphone and see them on your screen (Skype, and Facetime). Or you can create all these things yourself and share them with people all around the world.
				What is your favorite thing about technology? <br/><br/>
My favorite thing about technology is that it allows people to be innovative. If you find a problem, or you decide something in this world needs to be made better, computers can help you do it. </p>

				<p>Grade: 7 <br/><br/>
Why are you involved with Coders Unite? Why do you like this club? <br/><br/>

I am involved with this club because I have an interest in how and why things work as they do. This has sparked an interest in computers and programming that I have fulfilled in part by joining this club, where we are open to sharing ideas and code amongst ourselves. 
<br/><br/>What is your favorite thing about technology?<br/><br/>

My favorite thing about technology is that it opens doors for innovation in ways that could not be possible otherwise. I like how technology can be customized to be exactly how you want it. I also like the open-source/free/libre software movement because it inspires collaboration between people with various talents to create the best possible product, not the most marketable one.
